# Project Brief

Create a modern interactive web application tool that helps the user pick a number of colors (representing plastic chip colors) to use in a custom manufactured plastic sheet. 

The web app should have the following qualities:
- The user can define a palette consisting of anywhere between 1 to 10 colors. 
- Colors are defined as hex codes.
- Colors (and other buttons/info) are displayed on a sidebar on the left side of the screen.
- Colors defined by the user visualized on the right of the sidebar.
- The visualization shows what it would look like if an equal proportion of plastic chips of each defined color were used to manufacture a plastic sheet.
- The visualization takes the form of a voronoi diagram, where each cell is filled with a random color from the palette defined by the user.
