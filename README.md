# Colorway Designer

A "colorway" is a general pattern or texture of colors and shapes that define the visual look of a plastic sheet. Polygood manufactures sheets of plastic using recycled plastic chips. They have the ability to mix together different colored chips to produce a unique voronoi-like texture of colors in the plastic sheet. 

This web application is a tool to help pick color chips to include in a custom plastic sheet.
